## Concepts

### Accounts

The platform uses a unified account system for all users. Both restaurant operators and customers create the same type of account, providing seamless access to all platform features through a single login. This unified approach enables cross-feature functionality while maintaining simple access control.

### Brands

Brands serve as organizational containers for restaurant operations. Every operator must create at least one brand, even for single-location businesses. This structure enables future expansion and provides centralized management for menus, branding, and analytics across multiple locations.

### Restaurants

Restaurants represent individual business locations or storefronts under a brand. These can be physical establishments, online stores, or virtual concepts. Each restaurant operates independently with its own menu and settings, while maintaining brand consistency. A single brand can manage multiple restaurants across different regions or service types. Restaurants can be created without any friction or delay but need to be approved before they can be seen by users.

### Legal Documents

Legal documents are documents that show that your restaurant is legally runnning. This is to ensure the safety of the other businesses, the platform and more importantly the consumers of the food from the restaurants. Legal documents will be reciewed and have to be approved before the restaurant is available for users to order from.
